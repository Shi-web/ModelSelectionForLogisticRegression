In this lab, you will continue practicing the evaluation phase of the machine learning life cycle. You will perform model selection for logistic regression to solve a classification problem. You will complete the following tasks:

Build your DataFrame and define your ML problem:
Load the Airbnb "listings" data set
Define the label - what are you predicting?
Identify the features
Create labeled examples from the data set
Split the data into training and test data sets
Train, test and evaluate a logistic regression (LR) model using the scikit-learn default value for hyperparameter 
Perform a grid search to identify the optimal value of 
 for a logistic regression model
Train, test and evaluate a logisitic regression model using the optimal value of 
Plot a precision-recall curve for both models
Plot the ROC and compute the AUC for both models
Perform feature selection
Make your model persistent for future use
Note: Some of the code cells in this notebook may take a while to run.
